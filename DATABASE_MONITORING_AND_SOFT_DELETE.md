# Database Monitoring & Soft Delete Implementation

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

### üîç Database Monitoring (`lib/database-monitor.ts`)

**Features:**
- **Real-time health checks** - Automated database connectivity and performance monitoring
- **Query performance logging** - Tracks slow queries (>1s) and error rates
- **Connection pool monitoring** - PostgreSQL connection status and usage
- **Database size tracking** - Monitor database and table sizes
- **Automated alerts** - Console logging for performance issues
- **Prisma middleware integration** - Automatic query logging for all database operations

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Connection count and active queries
- Average query time and slow query count
- Error rate percentage and uptime
- Database size and table sizes
- Query performance logs with sanitized sensitive data

**API Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/admin/database/health` - Comprehensive health dashboard for admins

### üóëÔ∏è Soft Delete System (`lib/soft-delete.ts`)

**Features:**
- **User soft delete** - Anonymizes data but preserves records for integrity
- **Model archival** - Changes status to `DEPRECATED` instead of deletion
- **Subscription cancellation** - Marks as `CANCELLED` with history
- **Review/Discussion moderation** - Content replacement with removal notices
- **Creator profile handling** - Cascading soft delete for related data
- **Restoration framework** - Placeholder for data recovery (manual process)

**Protected Records:**
- **Users** ‚Üí Anonymized email/name, deactivated API keys, cancelled subscriptions
- **Models** ‚Üí Status changed to `DEPRECATED`, pricing plans deactivated
- **Subscriptions** ‚Üí Status changed to `CANCELLED`
- **Reviews** ‚Üí Content replaced with removal notice
- **Discussions** ‚Üí Content replaced with removal notice

**Admin Features:**
- `GET /api/admin/soft-delete` - List all soft deleted items
- `POST /api/admin/soft-delete` - Perform soft delete operations
- `GET /api/admin/soft-delete/cleanup` - Cleanup statistics
- `POST /api/admin/soft-delete/cleanup` - Dry run cleanup (safety first)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

**Data Protection:**
- Sensitive data sanitization in query logs
- Admin-only access with RBAC permissions
- 90-day retention policy for cleanup
- Dry-run mode for cleanup operations
- Audit trails with `deletedBy` tracking

**Recovery Options:**
- All soft deleted data remains in database
- Manual restoration process (requires admin intervention)
- Complete history preservation for compliance
- Cleanup operations logged for audit

## üìä **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### Monitoring Database Health
```typescript
import { databaseMonitor } from '@/lib/database-monitor'

// Get current health status
const health = await databaseMonitor.checkDatabaseHealth()
console.log(`Database healthy: ${health.healthy}`)

// Get performance metrics
const metrics = databaseMonitor.getMetrics()
console.log(`Average query time: ${metrics.avgQueryTime}ms`)

// Check slow queries
const slowQueries = databaseMonitor.getSlowQueries(5)
```

### Soft Delete Operations
```typescript
import { softDelete } from '@/lib/soft-delete'

// Soft delete a user (admin operation)
await softDelete.user('user_123', 'admin_456')

// Soft delete a model
await softDelete.model('model_789', 'admin_456')

// Cancel subscription
await softDelete.subscription('sub_101', 'admin_456')
```

### Admin API Calls
```bash
# Get database health (admin only)
curl -X GET /api/admin/database/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_token"

# List soft deleted items
curl -X GET /api/admin/soft-delete?type=users&limit=50 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_token"

# Perform soft delete
curl -X POST /api/admin/soft-delete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_token" \
  -d '{"action": "delete", "type": "user", "id": "user_123"}'
```

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### Database Monitoring Integration
- **Prisma middleware** automatically logs all database queries
- **Health checks** run every 5 minutes in production
- **Connection pool monitoring** uses PostgreSQL system tables
- **Performance thresholds** configurable (default: 1s for slow queries)

### Soft Delete Strategy
- **Status-based deletion** for models (`DEPRECATED`)
- **Data anonymization** for users (email ‚Üí `deleted_user_${id}@deleted.local`)
- **Cascade handling** for related records (creator profiles, subscriptions)
- **Preservation of relationships** for data integrity

### Safety Measures
- **Admin permissions required** for all operations
- **Dry run mode** for cleanup operations
- **Audit logging** for all delete operations
- **No permanent deletion** without explicit admin approval
- **Data sanitization** in logs to protect sensitive information

## üöÄ **PRODUCTION READY**

Both systems are **production-ready** with:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Admin permission checks
- ‚úÖ Audit trails and logging
- ‚úÖ Data integrity preservation
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Safety mechanisms

The monitoring system will help identify performance issues early, while the soft delete system ensures data safety and compliance with retention policies.

**Next Steps:** Database indexing strategy and Redis caching layer implementation.
